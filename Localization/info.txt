model_0 was generated in localize of PyTom commit b81f837

These original files removed to save space:
- occupancy_mask.mrc
- class_mask.mrc
- particle_locations.mrc
- grandmodel.mrc
- grandmodel_imag.mrc
- projections/*.mrc

Only the files providing ground truth to bin2 reconstruction, and the (noisefree) projections were kept.
